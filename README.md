### Overview
CAMs (Camp Application and Management System) is an Object-oriented application for the users (staff and students) to administer, inspect, and enroll for camps within NTU. We have focused on easy maintenance, extendibility, and reusability of this program during the design of the CAMs. This application supervises and supports the camps in NTU optimally, and can support future similar applications as well.
We used Java and gradle to build the application, with GitHub as the collaboration platform. 
The code was divided into the User, Camp, Request and User Interface packages. 


### What did we learn
- Application of SOLID principles
- How to build an application with high cohesion and low coupling
- Storing and accessing data stored in files (we weren't allowed to use a database)
